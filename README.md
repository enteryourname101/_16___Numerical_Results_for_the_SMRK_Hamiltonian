# Numerical Results for the SMRK Hamiltonian

## Overview

This document reports numerical results for the SMRK Hamiltonian evaluated under
the experimental framework defined previously.

Both positive and negative results are presented.

---

## What Is Evaluated

- Spectral matching with nontrivial zeta zeros
- Level spacing statistics
- Explicit formula residuals
- Stability under refinement
- Parameter sensitivity and tuning effects

---

## What This Paper Is Not

- Not a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis
- Not a claim of correctness of the SMRK Hamiltonian
- Not selective or confirmatory reporting

---

## Key Value

- Demonstrates how numerical agreement can be misleading
- Shows the decisive role of explicit formula diagnostics
- Establishes realistic standards for operator evaluation

---

## Transparency

Failure modes are documented explicitly:

- spectral overfitting at low truncation
- instability under refinement
- arithmetic incompatibility
- numerical pathologies

---

## Status

- Honest numerical study
- Falsification-oriented
- Fully reproducible
- Inconclusive by design
